This tutorial provides a walk-through for creating the `metadata` section of an OSCAL document, which appears in all OSCAL documents.

Before reading this tutorial you should:

- Have some familiarity with the [XML](https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/core), [JSON](https://www.json.org/), or [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/) formats.
- Have a basic understanding of the OSCAL models and their [overall structure](/concepts/layer/overview/).


Document metadata in OSCAL appears in two locations:

1. The document's [universally unique identifier](#document-uuid) (UUID).
2. The document's [metadata section](#what-is-the-metadata-section).

This tutorial explores both of these topics.

## Document UUID

All OSCAL documents use a UUID [RFC4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) to provide a stable and unique way to refer to a given instance of an OSCAL document. UUIDs are generated when the OSCAL document is created or revised.

While not strictly part of the `metadata` section of an OSCAL document, this document identifier is part of the OSCAL document's core metadata.

OSCAL supports two types of UUIDs:

- [Version 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html#section-4.4): A randomly or pseudo-randomly generated UUID.
- [Version 5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html#section-4.3): A name-based UUID based on SHA-1 hashing.

The OSCAL program recommends using a version 4 (random) UUID as the document identifier, which is highly resistant to [collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Collisions).

Many tools and programming APIs provide easy ways to generate version 4 and 5 UUIDs.

For our example we have generated the UUID `c3da6d1d-c20c-4c7c-ae73-4010167a186b` using a trivial UUIDv4 generator.

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=false" >}}
<catalog uuid="c3da6d1d-c20c-4c7c-ae73-4010167a186b">
{{< /highlight >}}

An OSCAL document's UUID is provided by the `@uuid` attribute, based on the [uuid](/reference/datatypes/#uuid) datatype, on the document's root element. In this example, the root element is `catalog`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{
  "catalog": {
    "uuid": "c3da6d1d-c20c-4c7c-ae73-4010167a186b"
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

An OSCAL document's UUID is provided by the `uuid` property, based on the [uuid](/reference/datatypes/#uuid) datatype, on the document's top-level object. In this example, the top-level object is identified by the property `catalog`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
---
catalog:
  uuid: c3da6d1d-c20c-4c7c-ae73-4010167a186b

{{< /highlight >}}

An OSCAL document's UUID is provided by the `uuid` key, based on the [uuid](/reference/datatypes/#uuid) datatype, at the document's top-level. In this example, the top-level key is named `catalog`.

## What is the Metadata Section?

All OSCAL models share some common structure and elements, as discussed in *[Common High-Level Structure](/concepts/layer/overview/#common-high-level-structure)*. The foremost of these is the metadata section, which includes important identifying and categorizing information for an OSCAL document. The metadata section contains several mandatory fields that are vital to the processing of OSCAL documents and help ensure interoperability, as well as optional fields that are designed to provide OSCAL content creators great flexibility in expressing additional information. 

As with all parts of OSCAL, the metadata section can be represented in XML, JSON, and YAML, which each support representing an equivalent set of information. Examples in this tutorial are provided for XML, JSON, and YAML to show the equivalent representations.

## Metadata Fields

The OSCAL metaschema reference ([XML](/reference/latest/complete/xml-definitions/#/assembly/oscal-metadata/metadata) | [JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/complete/json-definitions/#/assembly/oscal-metadata/metadata)) provides a comprehensive listing of the metadata section's data fields.  Below is the high-level structure of the metadata section in XML, JSON, and YAML followed by a listing of each fields' purpose.

## Creating a Metadata Section

Lets start with a nominal example of an OSCAL catalog document to demonstrate how to create the metadata section.

{{% callout note %}}
The data structure of the metadata section is identical in all OSCAL models, so the demonstrated constructs in this tutorial apply to all OSCAL models.
{{% /callout %}}

The metadata section contains fields which may be categorized as:
- required
- recommended
- extensions
- and other optional fields

The following sections demonstrate how the aforementioned field categories can be used to support specific use cases.

### Using Required and Recommended Fields

First, we start with the document's title, which is intended to be brief, human-readable text that will help a reader understand the context of the document.

The following is an example of what a title might look like expressed in OSCAL:

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}
<title>Example OSCAL Catalog</title>
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{
  "title": "Example OSCAL Catalog"
}
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
title: Example OSCAL Catalog
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

As you can see, the title is expressed in a very similar way across the different formats.

Next, we have the published and last modified date/time fields that represent when the document was published for the first time and most recently changed respectively. These field values are expressed using the OSCAL [dataTime-with-timezone](/reference/datatypes/#datetime-with-timezone) data type, which requires that the time zone offset is included to provide a localized time. By providing a localized timezone, the local time in any timezone can be calculated when using this information.

Lets look at a scenario where an OSCAL document was:
- published on January 1st, 2021 at "midnight" or 12:00AM with a time offset of 5 hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
- updated on January 5th, 2021 at "midnight" or 12:00AM with a time offset of 5 hours from UTC

This information would be expressed in OSCAL as follows in the metadata section:

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}
<published>2021-01-01T00:00:00-5:00</published>
<last-modified>2021-01-05T00:00:00-5:00</last-modified>
{{< /highlight >}}

The `<published>` element gives the date and time of when the document was published for the first time. This element is <em>not</em> required, but including it is strongly recommended to help the OSCAL document consumer understand when the document was originally published.

The `<last-modified>` element provides the the date and time of the most recent change to this document. If a document was published and then never updated, the `<last-modified>` value should be identical to the one given by `<published>`.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{
  "published": "2021-01-01T00:00:00-05:00",
  "last-modified": "2021-01-05T00:00:00-05:00"
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The `published` property gives the date and time of when the document was published for the first time. This field is <em>not</em> required, but including it is strongly recommended to help the OSCAL document consumer understand when the document was originally published.


The `last-modified` property provides the the date and time of the most recent change to this document. If a document was published and then never updated, the `last-modified` value should be identical to the one given by `published`.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
  published: 2021-01-01T00:00:00-05:00
  last-modified: 2021-01-05T00:00:00-05:00
{{< /highlight >}}

The `published` key gives the date and time of when the document was published for the first time. This key is <em>not</em> required, but including it is strongly recommended to help the OSCAL document consumer understand when the document was originally published.

The `last-modified` key provides the the date and time of the most recent change to this document. If a document was published and then never updated, the `last-modified` value should be identical to the one given by `published`.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

Next, we must provide the version of the content. This refers to the version of the OSCAL document instance itself, not the version of any other content.

OSCAL does not place requirements on the version string itself, as versioning is a complicated process that differs from content creator to content creator. Where possible, it is recommended to use well formatted versions with a clear and well defined syntax. The NIST OSCAL team uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as the versioning scheme for all schema, metaschema, and OSCAL documents we maintain, which is a generally accepted best practice for versioning.

Since this is the first time we've created this document, we will use the semantic version "1.0.0".

This information would be expressed in OSCAL as follows in the metadata section:

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=false" >}}
<version>1.0.0</version>
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{
  "version":"1.0.0"
}
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
version: 1.0.0
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

This version will be incremented whenever the OSCAL document is updated.

Finally, it is required to specify the version of OSCAL that was used when creating the document. This value provides an indicator to tools processing the data, which version of OSCAL to consider the data [valid](/concepts/validation/) with.

The OSCAL version is expressed in OSCAL as follows in the metadata section:

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}
<oscal-version>1.0.4</oscal-version>
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{
  "oscal-version":"1.0.4"
}
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
oscal-version: 1.0.4
{{< /highlight >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

We have now covered all required and recommended fields of the metadata section, and could publish our document as a valid OSCAL document. Here is what it would look like all together:

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}

However, the metadata section has several other optional but important fields which we will cover in the following sections.

### Providing additional document identifiers

OSCAL documents, by their nature, may often require updates of varying impact. It is important to track these updates in a way that can be automated and managed by a wide array of systems and users. To that end, we must cover the concepts of "Document Series" and "Document Series Instances".

A "Document Series" consists of all formats, updates and versions of a given document. In more human terms, if a content author writes "Document 1 version 1", "Document 1 version 2", and "Document 1 version 3.4", we could say that the "Document Series" is simply "Document 1". Furthermore, if a document author produces PDF, OSCAL JSON, and other formats of the same information, it may be useful to identify the entire collection of formats and versions in a single "Document Series".

A "Document Series Instance" is a discrete document instance that is part of a "Document Series". Using the above example, "Document 1 version 2 represented in OSCAL JSON" is a "Document Series Instance".

In OSCAL we use a document identifier to identify that a document is a member of a "Document Series" and a document UUID to identify a "Document Series Instance".

In the above example, OSCAL we add a `<document-id>` to track the "Document Series" identified by the [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org/driven_by_DOI.html) (DOI) System using the identifier `10.1000/182`.

The DOI System is indicated using the `@scheme` attribute value `https://www.doi.org/`, which is standardized in OSCAL ([XML](/reference/latest/complete/xml-definitions/#/field/oscal-metadata/document-id/scheme), [JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/complete/json-definitions/#/field/oscal-metadata/document-id/scheme)). A schema is required to be a [URI](/reference/datatypes/#uri).

In the above example, OSCAL we add an object to the `document-ids` array to track the "Document Series" identified by the [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org/driven_by_DOI.html) (DOI) System using the identifier `10.1000/182`.

The DOI System is indicated using the `scheme` property value `https://www.doi.org/`, which is standardized in OSCAL ([XML](/reference/latest/complete/xml-definitions/#/field/oscal-metadata/document-id/scheme), [JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/complete/json-definitions/#/field/oscal-metadata/document-id/scheme)).

In the future, any updated versions of this document that are produced will have the same "Document Series" identifier, but a different document identifier.

In the case that a document does not explicitly provide a "Document Series" identifier as above, it is given one implicitly that is equal to it's document identifier. This means that if we publish a new document without a `<document-id>`, then later need to publish an update to it, we can tie it back to the original document.

Multiple "Document Series" identifiers can be provided for a document instance to denote that a document is a part of multiple Document Series.

### Using Optional Extensions

Like most OSCAL objects, the metadata section provides for the ability to define [properties](#properties) and link relationships.

#### Properties

In OSCAL properties are namespaced, key/value pairs that allow additional information to provided that annotate the containing object. In the metadata section, properties are used to provide document-level annotations. Common use cases for properties includes providing keywords, tags, and classifications.

{{% callout note %}}
More information on the use of properties is provided in the [Props and Links tutorial](/learn/tutorials/extensions/#props).
{{% /callout %}}

For this example, we will create a property named `marking` in the default OSCAL namespace `http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal` to mark an OSCAL document with a [Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)](https://www.first.org/tlp/) classification of `red`. 

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}
<prop name="marking" value="red" class="http://www.first.org/tlp"/>
{{< /highlight >}}

The `<prop>` element above declares the desired property. The `@name` attribute is the property's key, which is in the default OSCAL namespace `http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal`, since no `@ns` is provided. The `@value` attribute is the property's value.

Together they form a key-value pair to facilitate automated data lookup. Here we use the optional `@class` attribute to provide an additional layer of information, noting that the marking we are using is the TLP protocol, as indicated using the `http://www.first.org/tlp` scheme. 
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{
  "props": [
    {
      "name": "marking",
      "value": "red",
      "class": "http://www.first.org/tlp"
    }
  ]
}
{{< /highlight >}}

We add an object to the `props` array to declare the desired property. The `name` field is the property's key, which is in the default OSCAL namespace `http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal`, since no `ns` field is provided. The `value` field is the property's value.

Together they form a key-value pair to facilitate automated data lookup. Here we use the optional `class` field to provide an additional layer of information, noting that the marking we are using is the TLP protocol, as indicated using the `http://www.first.org/tlp` scheme.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab %}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
props:
- name: marking
  value: red
  class: http://www.first.org/tlp
{{< /highlight >}}

We add an item to the `props` list to declare the desired property. The `name` field is the property's key, which is in the default OSCAL namespace `http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal`, since no `ns` field is provided. The `value` field is the property's value.

Together they form a key-value pair to facilitate automated data lookup. Here we use the optional `class` field to provide an additional layer of information, noting that the marking we are using is the TLP protocol, as indicated using the `http://www.first.org/tlp` scheme.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

This completes defining the marking property.

#### Links

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}
Alongside the `<prop>` element, `<link>` is a way of providing additional information in the metadata section that is not covered by the other elements. Each `<link>` must contain a single `@href` attribute, which contains a resolvable URI. Each `<link>` should also include a `@rel` attribute, which describes the type of relationship provided by the `@href`.  

{{% callout note %}}
The [Props and Links tutorial](/learn/tutorials/extensions/#links) provides comprehensive examples of how to implement a `<link>`.
{{% /callout %}}

For this example, we will create a "latest-version" link, which provides a static link to the latest version of this Document Series. By pointing to a static URL, but updating the contents of that URL as the document is updated, any user that has an old version of the document can quickly and easily update.

{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}
<link rel="latest-version"
      href="https://www.example.com/catalog/exampleoscalcatalog/latest"/>
{{< /highlight >}}

The "predecessor-version" and "successor-version" links could be used in tandem with the above to create a navigable web of document versions.

By using other custom `@rel` values, any relevant or related resource can be described and linked to in the OSCAL document's metadata section.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab %}}
Alongside the `props` array, the `links` array is a way of providing additional information in the Metadata section that is not covered by the other fields. Each object inside the `links` array must contain a single `href` field, which contains a resolvable URI. Each object should also include a `rel` field, which describes the type of relationship provided by the `href`.

### Using Other Optional Fields

{{< tabs XML JSON YAML >}}
{{% tab %}}

The remainder of this tutorial briefly covers the other optional elements inside the metadata section. While not required by the specification, these elements provide invaluable information, particularly for provenance and authorship data. This information is declared in the metadata section, and is often passed by-reference to other parts of the OSCAL document. Each element can be clicked to get additional information.

[`<role>`](/reference/latest/catalog/xml-reference/#/catalog/metadata/role) - Roles define some function or purpose that is to be assigned to some entity later in the document. Role elements have an `id` attribute with a [NCName](/reference/datatypes/#ncname) that is used to reference the role elsewhere in the OSCAL document. A number of pre-defined roles exist in OSCAL, but differ depending on context. In the metadata section they are as follows:

- prepared-by: Indicates the organization that created this content.
- prepared-for: Indicates the organization for which this content was created.
- content-approver: Indicates the organization responsible for all content represented in the "document".
Other roles can be locally defined by the content creator.

[`<location>`](/reference/latest/catalog/xml-reference/#/catalog/metadata/location) - Geographic data defined by a street address. Locations have a `@uuid` attribute that allow them to be referenced elsewhere in the OSCAL document. Includes elements to describe a variety of data describing the location in question.

[`<party>`](/reference/latest/catalog/xml-reference/#/catalog/metadata/party) - Defines some entity, either a person or an organization. Has a `@uuid` attribute that allows for references to this party elsewhere in the OSCAL document. Includes elements to describe a variety of data describing the party in question, including a location uuid.

[`<responsible-party>`](/reference/latest/catalog/xml-reference/#/catalog/metadata/responsible-party) - Explicitly declares a party that is responsible for a given role. The `@role-id` attribute references the role that the party is fulfilling, and is either a custom role locally defined or one of the core-defined roles; see the `<role>` section above for details. Uses a party's uuid to link the given role to the given party.

[`<remarks>`]((/reference/latest/catalog/xml-reference/#/catalog/metadata/remarks)) - [Markup](/reference/datatypes/#markup-data-types) formatted plaintext with notes and remarks regarding the metadata section of this document.

- content-approver: Indicates the organization responsible for all content represented in the "document".
Other roles can be locally defined by the content creator.

[`locations`](/reference/latest/catalog/json-reference/#/catalog/metadata/locations) - An array of location objects. Geographic data defined by a street address. Locations have a `uuid` field that allow them to be referenced elsewhere in the OSCAL document. Includes fields to describe a variety of data describing the location in question.

[`parties`](/reference/latest/catalog/json-reference/#/catalog/metadata/parties) - An array of party objects. Defines some entity, either a person or an organization. Has a `uuid` field that allows for references to this party elsewhere in the OSCAL document. Includes fields to describe a variety of data describing the party in question, including a location uuid.

[`responsible-parties`](/reference/latest/catalog/json-reference/#/catalog/metadata/responsible-parties) - An array of responsible-party objects. Explicitly declares a party that is responsible for this a given role. The `role-id` field references the role that the party is fulfilling, and is either a custom role locally defined or one of the core-defined roles; see the `roles` section above for details. Uses a party's uuid to link the given role to the given party.

## Summary

This concludes the tutorial. At this point you should be familiar with:

- The basic structure of the metadata section.
- How to provide the basic metadata required to be included in an OSCAL document.
- How to use and understand UUIDs and document-ids to track document instances
- How to use optional fields to express additional metadata and extend the metadata section
